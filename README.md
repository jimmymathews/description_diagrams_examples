# Tools for attempted solutions of the data-cube Steiner problem (and visualization of the results in the 3d case?).

Basic functionality can be tested with:

```
python3 homological_data_cube_diagrams.py
```

By reading the code, you can get a sense of what exact problem formulation is being used. This still needs work.

Currently there's a hodge podge of functions, but the basic data structures are there: facets of the cube, "flags" of facets representing cells in the barycentric subdivision.
